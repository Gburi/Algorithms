#### Introduction to Quick Sort
Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm due to its efficiency and simplicity. It follows the divide-and-conquer principle, working by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

#### Step-by-Step Quick Sort

1. **Choose a Pivot**
   Select a pivot element from the array. This can be any element, but for simplicity, let's choose the first element.

2. **Partition the Array**
   Rearrange the elements in the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it and all elements greater come after it.

3. **Recursive Sort**
   Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays of elements with smaller and greater values.

4. **Combine**
   The base case of the recursion is arrays of size zero or one, which are inherently sorted. Combine the sorted sub-arrays and pivot into a single sorted array.

#### Example of Quick Sort

Let's consider the array `[10, 5, 2, 3]` and sort it using Quick Sort.

1. **Initial Array:**
   `[10, 5, 2, 3]`

2. **Choose Pivot:**
   Let's choose `10` as the pivot.

3. **Partition:**
   All elements less than `10` go to the left, and all elements greater go to the right.
   - Left: `[5, 2, 3]`
   - Pivot: `10`
   - Right: `[]`

4. **Recursive Sort on Left:**
   Sort `[5, 2, 3]`
   - Choose `5` as the pivot.
   - Left: `[2, 3]`
   - Pivot: `5`
   - Right: `[]`

5. **Recursive Sort on `[2, 3]`:**
   - Choose `2` as the pivot.
   - Left: `[]`
   - Pivot: `2`
   - Right: `[3]`
   
   Combine to get `[2, 3]`.

6. **Combine `[2, 3]` and `5`:**
   Combine to get `[2, 3, 5]`.

7. **Final Combination:**
   Combine `[2, 3, 5]` and `10` to get `[2, 3, 5, 10]`.

The array `[10, 5, 2, 3]` is now sorted as `[2, 3, 5, 10]`.

#### Conclusion
Quick sort is an efficient and widely used sorting algorithm. Understanding its mechanism helps in grasping more complex algorithms and improving problem-solving skills in algorithm design. The simplicity of its implementation and the power of its performance make it a key tool in the programmer's toolkit.
